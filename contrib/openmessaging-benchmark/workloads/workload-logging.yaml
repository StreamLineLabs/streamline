# Log Aggregation Workload
#
# Simulates centralized logging infrastructure:
# - Application logs from multiple services
# - Larger message sizes (log lines, stack traces)
# - Bursty traffic (errors cause log storms)
# - High durability requirements
#
# Characteristics:
# - Variable message sizes (avg 2KB, up to 10KB for stack traces)
# - Moderate throughput sustained, with burst capacity
# - Single consumer for aggregation (ELK, Splunk, etc.)
# - Ordering less critical (timestamp in payload)
# - Must not lose logs (at-least-once delivery)
