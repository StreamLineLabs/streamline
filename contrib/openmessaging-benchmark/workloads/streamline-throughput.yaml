# Streamline Maximum Throughput Benchmark
#
# Stress test workload to measure maximum sustainable throughput.
# Uses smaller messages and more producers to maximize message rate.
# Completes in approximately 30 minutes.
#
# Usage:
#   bin/benchmark --drivers driver-streamline/streamline.yaml \
#                 --workloads workloads/streamline-throughput.yaml
