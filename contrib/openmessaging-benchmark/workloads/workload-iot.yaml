# IoT Sensor Data Workload
#
# Simulates IoT telemetry ingestion with:
# - Millions of sensors sending small messages
# - Very high message rate (100K+ msgs/sec)
# - Small payloads (sensor readings)
# - Real-time processing requirements
#
# Characteristics:
# - Extremely high throughput
# - Small message sizes (128-256 bytes typical)
# - Many producers (simulating sensors)
# - Time-series friendly (timestamp-ordered)
# - Can tolerate some message loss (at-most-once OK)
